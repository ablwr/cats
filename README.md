# cats cats cats!

Based on [sl](https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl) and [gti](https://github.com/rwos/gti), for when you mistype `cat` in bash!

To install:

- `git clone` this directory and `cd` into the folder.
- Run `make` (this kicks off `cats.c` and builds the file)
- Run `./cats` to test it out!

If you LOVE IT, you can add the command to your global bash settings by running `cp cats /usr/local/bin/cats` (or wherever your $PATH may be).
